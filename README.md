<h1> <u>SELF CONTROL AND BALANCING CAMERA PLATFORM</u></h1>

  

<h2>OVERVIEW: </h2>

Control system is designed to stabilize the camera gimbal system used in different airborne systems for applications such as target tracking, surveillance, aerial photography, autonomous navigation and so on. The technique is applied in everything from self-stabilizing cameras to helicopters and noise reducing equipment.

This camera gimbal system replaces many traditional tracking systems such as radar which are heavy and large to mount on air vehicles. So, the stabilization of camera gimbal is very important to eliminate shakes and vibrations in photography, provides accura
